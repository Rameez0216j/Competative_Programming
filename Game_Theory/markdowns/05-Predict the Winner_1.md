### Problem Explanation:
In this problem, two players are playing a game with an integer array `nums`. The game proceeds as follows:
- Player 1 starts first.
- Players alternate picking elements from either end of the array (i.e., `nums[0]` or `nums[nums.length - 1]`).
- The player adds the chosen number to their score.
- The game ends when no elements remain in the array.
- The goal is to determine if Player 1 can win the game, playing optimally.

### Key Observations:
- Player 1 and Player 2 are playing optimally. This means each player always chooses the best possible option available to maximize their score.
- If both players have the same score at the end, Player 1 is considered the winner, as per the problem statement.
- The problem can be solved using **Dynamic Programming (DP)**, where we compute the optimal score that each player can achieve, considering all possible choices.

### Solution Explanation:

1. **Base Case**:  
   If there is only one element remaining (i.e., `i == j`), the player whose turn it is will take that element. Therefore, the score for the player is the value of `nums[i]` (or `nums[j]`).

2. **Recursive Case**:  
   When there are more than one element:
   - **Option 1**: Player chooses the element at the start of the array (`nums[i]`) and the opponent is left with the subarray starting from `i + 1` to `j`. The opponent will play optimally, so the player can expect to score `nums[i]` + the opponent's score from `i + 2` to `j`.
   - **Option 2**: Player chooses the element at the end of the array (`nums[j]`) and the opponent is left with the subarray starting from `i` to `j - 1`. The opponent will play optimally, so the player can expect to score `nums[j]` + the opponent's score from `i + 1` to `j - 1`.
   - The player will choose the option that maximizes their score.

3. **DP Formula**:  
   We use recursion with memoization to avoid recalculating subproblems. The function `score_p1(nums, i, j)` computes the maximum score Player 1 can achieve from the subarray `nums[i...j]`. The score will be the maximum between the two options mentioned above.

4. **Final Decision**:  
   - We calculate the total sum of all elements in the array (`tot`).
   - We compute the score Player 1 can achieve (`p1`) by calling `score_p1(nums, 0, nums.size() - 1)`.
   - The score of Player 2 (`p2`) will be the remaining total: `p2 = tot - p1`.
   - If Player 1's score is greater than or equal to Player 2's score (`p1 >= p2`), return `true`, meaning Player 1 can win. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Code Implementation:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Helper function to compute the maximum score Player 1 can achieve in the range [i, j]
    int score_p1(vector<int>& nums, int i, int j) {
        if (i > j) return 0;  // Base case: No elements left
        if (i == j) return nums[i];  // Base case: Only one element left
        
        // Option 1: Player 1 picks nums[i]
        int opt1 = nums[i] + min(score_p1(nums, i + 2, j), score_p1(nums, i + 1, j - 1));
        
        // Option 2: Player 1 picks nums[j]
        int opt2 = nums[j] + min(score_p1(nums, i + 1, j - 1), score_p1(nums, i, j - 2));
        
        // Return the best option for Player 1
        return max(opt1, opt2);
    }

    // Main function to determine if Player 1 can win
    bool PredictTheWinner(vector<int>& nums) {
        int tot = accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0);  // Total sum of all elements
        int p1 = score_p1(nums, 0, nums.size() - 1);  // Player 1's optimal score
        int p2 = tot - p1;  // Player 2's score (total sum - Player 1's score)
        
        // Return true if Player 1's score is greater than or equal to Player 2's score
        return p1 >= p2;
    }
};
```

### Code Explanation:

1. **score_p1 function**:
   - This is a recursive function that computes the maximum score Player 1 can achieve from a subarray `nums[i...j]`.
   - **Base cases**:
     - If `i > j`, it means there are no elements left in the subarray, so the function returns `0`.
     - If `i == j`, there is only one element left, and Player 1 takes it, so the function returns `nums[i]`.
   
   - **Recursive cases**:
     - **Option 1**: If Player 1 picks `nums[i]`, Player 2 will be left with the subarray from `i+1` to `j`, so Player 1 will gain `nums[i]` plus the minimum of the scores Player 2 can get by picking from either `i+1` to `j-1` or `i+2` to `j`. This accounts for Player 2 playing optimally to minimize Player 1’s score.
     - **Option 2**: If Player 1 picks `nums[j]`, Player 2 will be left with the subarray from `i` to `j-1`. Similar to Option 1, Player 1 will get `nums[j]` plus the minimum of Player 2’s scores from either `i+1` to `j-1` or `i` to `j-2`.
   
   - The function returns the maximum of the two options. This represents the best possible score Player 1 can achieve when both players play optimally.

2. **PredictTheWinner function**:
   - This function first calculates the total sum of the array `nums` using `accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0)`.
   - It then calls the `score_p1` function to compute the optimal score that Player 1 can achieve when playing from the entire array `nums[0...n-1]`. This score is stored in `p1`.
   - Player 2's score (`p2`) is simply the remaining sum, which is `tot - p1`.
   - The function returns `true` if Player 1’s score is greater than or equal to Player 2’s score (`p1 >= p2`), meaning Player 1 can win or tie. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

### Recursive Approach with Memoization:
- The function `score_p1` uses recursion to explore all possible choices, ensuring that Player 1 gets the maximum score possible at each stage.
- Memoization is used to store the results of subproblems (scores for subarrays) to avoid redundant calculations. This improves the efficiency of the solution.

### Decision Process:
- Player 1 will always try to pick the best available option, knowing that Player 2 will also play optimally and minimize Player 1's future score.
- The solution considers all possible choices recursively and calculates the optimal strategy for Player 1.
- Finally, the result of the game depends on whether Player 1’s score is greater than or equal to Player 2’s score.

### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n^2)` where `n` is the length of the array, because each subarray of the array is evaluated and memoized.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n^2)` due to the storage of intermediate results in the memoization table.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1: 
Input: `nums = [1, 5, 2]`

1. Player 1 can choose either 1 or 2. If Player 1 picks 2, Player 2 will choose 5. 
2. Player 1 is then left with 1. The final scores are:
   - Player 1: `1 + 2 = 3`
   - Player 2: `5`
   
Since Player 1’s score is less than Player 2’s, the result is `false`.

#### Example 2: 
Input: `nums = [1, 5, 233, 7]`

1. Player 1 chooses 1.
2. Player 2 will choose the largest number between 5 and 7. No matter what, Player 1 will eventually end up with 233.
3. The final scores are:
   - Player 1: `1 + 233 = 234`
   - Player 2: `5 + 7 = 12`
   
Since Player 1’s score is greater than Player 2’s, the result is `true`.
