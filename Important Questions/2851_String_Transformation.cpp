/*
======================== Problem Insight ====================

    We have two strings:
        - str  → starting string
        - pat  → target pattern (treated as the "good" string)

    Allowed operation:
        - Pick a suffix of length l (1 <= l < n) from the current string
        and move it to the front (this is equivalent to rotating the string).

    Goal:
        - Find the number of ways to transform str into pat in exactly k operations.

======================== Step 1: Classify States ====================

    - Total possible unique rotations of a string of length n = n
    (rotation by 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1 positions)

    - A rotation is called a "good" rotation if it matches pat.
    - Let:
        g = number of "good" rotations
        b = n - g = number of "bad" rotations (not matching pat)

    We can find g efficiently using a string matching algorithm
    (KMP, Z-function, etc.) on (pat + '#' + str + str).

======================== Step 2: State Compression ====================

    Instead of tracking each rotation individually, notice:
        - All good rotations behave the same way in terms of transitions.
        - All bad rotations behave the same way.

    So we only track:
        current_good = number of ways we are currently in a good state
        current_bad  = number of ways we are currently in a bad state

======================== Step 3: Transition Rules ====================

    From a GOOD rotation:
        - To another GOOD rotation: (g - 1) ways (cannot stay in same rotation)
        - To a BAD rotation: b ways

    From a BAD rotation:
        - To a GOOD rotation: g ways
        - To another BAD rotation: (b - 1) ways (cannot stay in same rotation)

    Thus, one step transition is:

    [next_good, next_bad] =
        [current_good, current_bad] *
        [[g - 1, g],
        [  b  , b - 1]]

======================== Step 4: Transition Matrix ====================

    Let:
        T = [[g - 1, g],
            [  b  , b - 1]]

    Then:
        [good_k, bad_k] = [good_0, bad_0] * (T ^ k)

    Where:
        - [good_0, bad_0] is the initial state
        - good_0 = 1 if str == pat, else 0
        - bad_0  = 1 - good_0

======================== Step 5: Efficient Computation ====================

    Since k can be as large as 1e15, simulate steps using
    matrix exponentiation in O(log k) time.

    Final answer:
        - Return good_k (mod 1e9+7)

======================== Summary ====================

    1. Compute g using string matching.
    2. b = n - g
    3. Build transition matrix T.
    4. Compute T^k using fast exponentiation.
    5. Multiply initial state by T^k.
    6. Answer = resulting good_k.
